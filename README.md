# End-to-End Supply Chain Analytics (Python, MySQL, Power BI)

## Objective :
The objective of this Supply Chain Analytics Project is to build a complete end-to-end data pipeline and analytical system using Python, MySQL, and Power BI to improve supply chain 
efficiency and support data-driven business decisions. Cleaned and transformed raw data using Python, designed a relational database with a 6-table schema in MySQL, and performed advanced SQL
queries to analyze key supply chain metrics. Then visualized these insights in interactive Power BI dashboards. This analysis covers shipment performance, customer behavior, product 
profitability, regional revenue trends, supplier distribution, and operational KPIs across 13,500 orders, 1,600 customers, 126 products, 20 suppliers, and 10 warehouses.
Through this project, demonstrated my ability to build ETL workflows, model relational databases, write complex SQL queries, calculate business-critical metrics (YOY sales, 
profit %, delivery performance), and convert raw data into meaningful insights that support strategic decision-making in logistics and supply chain operations.
